# Example Apartment One Time Password

Example Rails Todos application making use of the Apartment and rotp libraries.

The user can sign in with a guest account or create an account with a one time password. The excellent [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) application is recommended for use with this project and the default port set in the `config/environments/development.rb` file is set to 1025.

## Getting Started

Install the correct libraries:
```
bundle insall
```

Run the migrations for the authentication database:
```
rails db:migrate:auth

```

Run the migrations for the tenant Todos database:
```

rails db:migrate:primary
```

Run the Rails server with the following command:
```
rails server
```

The tenant database is created when a user signs in. If you want to seed the database for records run the following after:
```
rails db:seed
```
Note that the above action iterates all tenant databases.
